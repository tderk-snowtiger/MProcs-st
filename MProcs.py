No, that deed is well done of which a man does not repent, and the reward of which he receives gladly and cheerfully.", "69.

An evil deed, like newly-drawn milk, does not turn (suddenly); smouldering, like fire covered by ashes, it follows the fool.", "72. And when the evil deed, after it has become known, brings sorrow to the fool, then it destroys his bright lot, nay, it cleaves his head.", "73.

Well-makers lead the water (wherever they like); fletchers bend the arrow; carpenters bend a log of wood; wise people fashion themselves.", "81. As a solid rock is not shaken by the wind, wise people falter not amidst blame and praise.", "82. Wise people, after they have listened to the laws, become serene, like a deep, smooth, and still lake.", "83. Good people walk on whatever befall, the good do not prattle, longing for pleasure; whether touched by happiness or sorrow wise people never appear elated or depressed.", "84. If, whether for his own sake, or for the sake of others, a man wishes neither for a son, nor for wealth, nor for lordship, and if he does not wish for his own success by unfair means, then he is good, wise, and virtuous.", "85. Few are there among men who arrive at the other shore (become Arhats); the other people here run up and down the shore.", "86. But those who, when the law has been well preached to them, follow the law, will pass across the dominion of death, however difficult to overcome.", "87, 88. A wise man should leave the dark state (of ordinary life), and follow the bright state (of the Bhikshu). After going from his home to a homeless state, he should in his retirement look for enjoyment where there seemed to be no enjoyment. Leaving all pleasures behind, and calling nothing his own, the wise man should purge himself from all the troubles of the mind.", "89. Those whose mind is well grounded in the (seven) elements of knowledge, who without clinging to anything, rejoice in freedom from attachment, whose appetites have been conquered, and who are full of light, are free (even) in this world.", "90. There is no suffering for him who has finished his journey, and abandoned grief, who has freed himself on all sides, and thrown off all fetters.", "91. They depart with their thoughts well-collected, they are not happy in their abode; like swans who have left their lake, they leave their house and home.", "92. Men who have no riches, who live on recognised food, who have perceived void and unconditioned freedom (Nirvana), their path is difficult to understand, like that of birds in the air.", "93. He whose appetites are stilled, who is not absorbed in enjoyment, who has perceived void and unconditioned freedom (Nirvana), his path is difficult to understand, like that of birds in the air.", "94. The gods even envy him whose senses, like horses well broken in by the driver, have been subdued, who is free from pride, and free from appetites.", "95. Such a one who does his duty is tolerant like the earth, like Indra's bolt; he is like a lake without mud; no new births are in store for him.", "96. His thought is quiet, quiet are his word and deed, when he has obtained freedom by true knowledge, when he has thus become a quiet man.", "97. The man who is free from credulity, but knows the uncreated, who has cut all ties, removed all temptations, renounced all desires, he is the greatest of men.", "98. In a hamlet or in a forest, in the deep water or on the dry land, wherever venerable persons (Arhanta) dwell, that place is delightful.", "99. Forests are delightful; where the world finds no delight, there the passionless will find delight, for they look not for pleasures.", "100. Even though a speech be a thousand (of words), but made up of senseless words, one word of sense is better, which if a man hears, he becomes quiet.", "101. Even though a Gatha (poem) be a thousand (of words), but made up of senseless words, one word of a Gatha is better, which if a man hears, he becomes quiet.", "102. Though a man recite a hundred Gathas made up of senseless words, one word of the law is better, which if a man hears, he becomes quiet.", "103.

But he who lives a hundred years, vicious and unrestrained, a life of one day is better if a man is virtuous and reflecting.", "111. And he who lives a hundred years, ignorant and unrestrained, a life of one day is better if a man is wise and reflecting.", "112. And he who lives a hundred years, idle and weak, a life of one day is better if a man has attained firm strength.", "113.

If a man does what is good, let him do it again; let him delight in it: happiness is the outcome of good.", "119.

Let no man think lightly of good, saying in his heart, It will not come nigh unto me. Even by the falling of water-drops a water-pot is filled; the wise man becomes full of good, even if he gather it little by little.", "123. Let a man avoid evil deeds, as a merchant, if he has few companions and carries much wealth, avoids a dangerous road; as a man who loves life avoids poison.", "124. He who has no wound on his hand, may touch poison with his hand; poison does not affect one who has no wound; nor is there evil for one who does not commit evil.", "125. If a man offend a harmless, pure, and innocent person, the evil falls back upon that fool, like light dust thrown up against the wind.", "126. Some people are born again; evil-doers go to hell; righteous people go to heaven; those who are free from all worldly desires attain Nirvana.", "127. Not in the sky, not in the midst of the sea, not if we enter into the clefts of the mountains, is there known a spot in the whole world where death could not overcome (the mortal).", "129.

If you say âno,â you are looking for life by cutting off your head.â The head monk said, âThe green mountain always lifts up its legs; you donât need to carry a lantern in the daylight.â [1] Rakuho said, âWhat time is this to utter such a saying?â A senior monk named Genjo stepped forward and said, âApart from these two ways, I beg you, Master, not to ask.â Rakuho said, âThatâs not enough. Say some more.â Genjo said, âI cannot say it fully.â Rakuho said, âI donât care whether or not you can say it fully.â Genjo said, âI feel just like an attendant who has nothing to respond to his master.â [2] That evening, Rakuho called Genjo to him and said, âYour response today had something quite reasonable. You have to realize what our late master [3] said, "There are no dharmas before the eyes, Yet consciousness is before the eyes. IT is not the Dharma before the eyes, IT cannot be reached by eyes and ears."" Which phrase is the guest? Which phrase is the host? If you can sort them out, I will transmit the bowl and robe to you.â Genjo said, âI donât understand.â Rakuho said, âYou must understand.â Genjo said, âI really donât understand.â Rakuho uttered a kaatz and said, âMiserable, miserable!â [Another] monk asked, âWhat would you like to say, Master?â Rakuho said, âThe boat of compassion is not rowed over pure waves. Itâs been wasted labor releasing wooden geese down the precipitous strait [4].â [1]: Most probably a saying formed by Rakuho himself. [2]: Apparently an idiomatic expression meaning, âI canât describe it in words.â [3]: Rinzai or Kassan. [4]: It was a custom that the boat rushing down the stream through a gorge released pieces of wood ahead as a warning so that a possible crash with the boat coming upstream could be avoided. These wooden chips were called âwooden geese.â', 'A monk asked National Teacher Chu of Nanyo, âWhat is the essential body [1] of Vairocana Buddha [2]?â National Teacher said, âPass me that water jug.â The monk passed him the water jug. National Teacher said, âPut it back where it was.â The monk asked again, âWhat is the essential body of Vairocana Buddha?â National Teacher said, âThe old Buddha is long gone.â [1]: The so-called âDharma-bodyâ or dharmakaya. [2]: The principal Buddha.', 'Razan asked Ganto, âWhat if things appear and disappear without ceasing?â Ganto scolded him saying, âWho appears and disappears?â', 'A monk asked Master Ho of Koyo, âThe great dragon has emerged from the ocean, calming heaven and earth. How will you treat him when he suddenly appears before you?â Master Ho said, âSuparnin [1], the king of birds, absorbs the entire universe. Who can stick his head within him?â The monk said, âBut how about when he does appear?â Ho said, âIt is like a falcon catching a pigeon. If you donât realize it, you will learn the truth through the âinspection before the balcony.â [2]â The monk said, âIf so, then Iâll fold my hands on my chest and retreat three steps.â Ho said, âYou black tortoise under the Sumeru altar. [3] Donât wait to be struck on the forehead again and get hurt.â [1]: A giant bird that eats even dragons. [2]: A reference to a story in which Heigenkun Chosho, the brother of the king of Cho and a wealthy landlord with 3,000 dependents, built a grand palace with a balcony that overlooked the main road. One day a crippled person was passing by and one of the concubines saw him and laughed. The crippled person was angered and demanded Heigenkun her head. Heigenkun presented the head of an executed convict as the head of the concubine. His dependents knew of his deception, lost faith in their master and gradually all left him. His fortunes declined, so at last he cut off the head of the concubine and presented it for the crippled person to inspect. After that the dependents returned and his fortunes were restored. The story is an allusion to the fact that you can never hide away the real truth. [3]: A reference to one of the four carved figures, representing black tortoises, underneath the Sumeru altar (with the Buddha statue). It is used here as a symbol of someone who has lost the freedom of movement.', 'The Engaku [1] Sutra says: âAt all times, you do not raise the delusive mind. When there are all kinds of illusory thoughts, you do not extinguish them. Dwelling in the delusory state of mind, you do not add understanding. Where there is no understanding, you do not distinguish the truth.â [1]: âEngakuâ means the perfect awakening of Buddha.', 'Great Master Tokusan Emmyo instructed his assembly and said, âIf you have exhausted to the end, you will realize right away that all buddhas in the three worlds have stuck their mouths to the wall [1]. Yet there is still one person Â¡Â© he is giving a great laugh. If you can recognize that person, you have accomplished your study.â [1]: I.e., they are unable to open their mouths.', 'A monk asked Joshu, âWhat is the meaning of the patriarchâs coming from the West?â Joshu said, âThe oak tree there in the garden.â', 'Vimalakirti asked Manjusri, âWhat does it mean that the Bodhisattva enters the Dharma-gate of Not-Two?â Manjusri said, âI see it like this: in all phenomena, there are neither words nor explanations, neither presentations nor knowledge; it is beyond all questions and answers. That is what I understand with /to enter the Dharma-gate of Not-Two/.â Then Manjusri asked Vimalakirti, âAll of us have finished giving our explanations. Now you should give your explanation. What does it mean that the Bodhisattva enters the Dharma-gate of Not-Two?â Vimalakirti remained silent.', 'When Tozan held a memorial service for Ungan before his portrait, he mentioned the episode with the portrait [1]. A monk came forward and asked, âWhen Ungan said, âJust this!â what did that mean?â Tozan said, âAt that time, I almost misunderstood my masterâs meaning.â The monk said, âI wonder whether or not Ungan really knew that IT is.â Tozan said, âIf he did not know that it is, how could he say like that? If he knew that it is, how did he dare say like that?â [1]: Tozan was still a young monk under Ungan. One day, when he was leaving his master, he asked Ungan, âAfter your passing, if I am asked by someone whether I have your portrait, what should I answer?â Ungan was silent for a while and then said, âJust this.â', 'When Seppo was living in a hermitage, two monks came to pay their respects. When he saw them coming, Seppo thrust open the gate of his hermitage with his hands, jumped out, and said, âWhat is this?â The monks also said, âWhat is this?â Seppo hung his head and retired into his hermitage. Later, the monks came to Ganto. He asked them, âWhere have you come from?â The monks said, âFrom Reinan.â Ganto said, âDid you ever visit Seppo?â The monks said, âYes, we visited him.â Ganto said, âWhat did he say?â The monks related what had happened. Ganto said, âWhat else did he say?â The monks said, âNot a word; he hung his head and retired into his hermitage.â Ganto said, âOh, how I regret now that in those days I did not tell him the last word! If I had told it to him, no one under heaven could do anything against him.â At the end of the summer practice period the monks came back to this conversation and asked him about its meaning. Ganto said, âWhy didnât you ask me about it sooner?â The monks said, âWe could not dare to ask you about it.â Ganto said, âSeppo was born on the same stem as I, but he will not die on the same stem. If you want to know the last word, it is just this.â']
